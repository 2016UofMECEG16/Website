This is the web server software for the University of Manitoba ECE Group 16 Capstone Project. This web server requires node.js. This server assumes that there is a MySQL server on the same machine running on port 3306 and accesses the database called "projectdb".

To use a different MySQL Server or database, alter the code as needed in the db.js file

To run the webserver, navigate to the root folder and run 

    node bin\www
